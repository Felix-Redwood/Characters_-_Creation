                        <p>Behind every clocktower lies a humble inventor, who slaved for hours, cutting each gear into shape by hand. Tinkerers and creators lie behind every city, and their best work will define a nation for centuries.</p>
                        <p>Artificers are something else. They infuse magic into their creations. Some become warriors, crafting their own firearms that shoot enchanted bullets. Others create flying companions that can conjure waves of fire onto enemies.</p>
                        <p>Artificers can rival all other spellcasters, their intelligence and quick-thinking allowing them to find out of the box solutions to problems that others may find impossible. Unlike other magic classes, artificer’s use gadgets
                            to cast their spells. For example, when casting fireball, you may be launching a fiery grenade from a launcher on your forearm. When casting a spell to help you understand a language, you might be placing a device in your ear
                            that will translate all languages you hear.</p>
                        <p>Due to this, artificers usually have the most creative ways of casting spells, and when you play one, you should think about how you might describe how your spells are casted. Here are some examples for you:</p>
                        <ul type="disc">
                            <li>Cure wounds: Applying a salve to a wound on the body</li>
                            <li>Darkvision: Placing a pair of goggles over your eyes that allow you to see in the dark</li>
                            <li>Fly: A pair of wings that burst from a backpack you’re carrying, or a pair of boots that rocket you into the air</li>
                            <li>Water breathing: A tank of infinite air, attached to a mask you place over your face</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Artificers rely on intelligence to cast their ‘spells’, relying on a deep understanding of how their inventions work in order to perform feats that most would consider impossible. They also use dexterity to craft their complex
                            creations. For this reason, races such as humans, gnomes and vedalken.</p>
                        <p>This being said, artificers aren’t just inventors, rather they use their inventions to bolster their other abilities. They might be fighters, archivists or alchemists. For this reason, you can play a variety of races when being
                            an artificer, and aren’t just restricted to those with a naturally high intelligence.</p>

                        <p>Barbarians are one of the most powerful classes in D&D, in terms of raw strength and damage, and they’re feared by anyone who truly knows their might. The common idea of the barbarian is that they’re a dumb brute, destroying everything
                            they see. While that may be true for some, barbarians vary greatly, and the smarter, wiser ones tend to be tribal chieftains, or soldiers on the frontlines of battle.</p>
                        <p>As a barbarian, you won’t have to wear armour. Instead you can grit your teeth and absorb the attacks of your enemies. You also gain the ability to rage, increasing your strength for a short period of time as your vision turns
                            red and the force of your strikes becomes enough to shake a castle. At later levels, your strength increases further, you gain the ability to just say “no” if you are killed (provided you roll a constitution saving throw),
                            and when you score a critical hit, you get to add extra dice to your damage.</p>
                        <p>There are a range of barbarians, from the simple berserker, who gain extra attacks from their frenzies, to more spiritual paths, such as the totem warrior, who worships an animal and gains features from them (such as the damage-resistance
                            of a bear, the wings of an eagle, the speed of an elk) or the ancestral guardian, who can call forth their ancestors to aid them in a battle.</p>
                        <p>Barbarians rely primarily on strength and constitution; if you take a more spiritual path then wisdom will come in handy as well. Races such as human, bugbear (a giant kind of goblin), orc, half-orc, dwarf, goliath (reclusive giant-kin
                            from the mountains), minotaur (yes you can play a minotaur in D&D) or tortle (a humanoid turtle) all work well as barbarians.</p>

                        <p>A common guard may have to fight, as may a bandit or a mercenary, but they are not true fighters. Fighters exist amongst criminals, knights and adventuring guilds, and show a natural drive towards combat, besting their enemies
                            with ease. Fighters, although strong and quick, excel in all areas, such as tactics, negotiation, infiltration and leadership. A skilled fighter will rise quickly through the ranks of the toughest, most prestigious army.</p>
                        <p>As a fighter, you gain multiple attacks, up to 4 per round at 20th level, allowing you to decimate your enemies before they’ve even drawn their weapons. You can also give yourself a surge of adrenaline, allowing you to attack even
                            more for 1 round. Finally, you get more improvements to your ability scores than any other class does.</p>
                        <p>There are a variety of paths you can go down as a fighter, from the champion, who scores up to 3 times as many critical hits as any other class, to the cavalier, who fights atop their mount, to the eldritch knight, who imbues their
                            attacks with magic, decapitating their enemy just before shooting an explosive fireball at the archers 60 feet away.</p>
                        <p>A fighter’s best abilities are their constitution and strength; however you may choose to be an archer or gunslinger, in which case dexterity is going to be more important. Races best suited to be a fighter include; human, centaur,
                            dragonborn, goliath, minotaur and warforged (robotic humans built from ancient times). That being said, fighter is such a varied class that it can be played by any race you wish.</p>

                        <p>Understanding and controlling the natural energy, the ki that flows through us all, the monk can perform nigh-impossible feats with ease. A monk can take on four armed opponents with only their fists, they can live to 70 and still
                            best a fully armoured foe, they can go up against a giant and still strike so hard that their foe is knocked onto their back.</p>
                        <p>Monks take the path of discipline, of training every day, and learning how to gain mastery over ki, the force that flows through everything. Monks may have spent their lives in a secluded monastery, or might’ve been taught by a
                            master and given relative freedom. They may have left their monastery for a variety of reasons; they might’ve been cast out or sent on an important mission.</p>
                        <p>Monks can catch arrows in midair and throw them back at enemies (that’s an actual ability by the way). They can dash, reaching speeds upwards of 120 feet in one round, that’s 20 feet a second! While some use weapons, you also have
                            the option of using your fists, which will eventually be tough enough to do the same damage as a warhammer!</p>
                        <p>There are several paths a monk goes down. The way of the drunken fist relies on feinting your enemies, appearing much weaker than you are. The way of the four elements or the sun soul are more magical, and allow you to cast spells.
                            There is also the way of the kensei, where you master a weapon, and use that, as a fighter might, against your enemies.</p>
                        <p>Monks’ power comes from their dexterity and wisdom, and as such, races such as humans, aarakocra (humanoid birds who can fly), elves, halflings, kenku (half birds whose flight and voice was taken from them) and tabaxi (humanoid
                            felines) will all make a good monk. That being said, you may choose to create a strength based monk if you desire.</p>

                        <p>Unlike what is commonly thought, bards are not just musicians. They may be poets, playwrights or simply humble storytellers. A bard’s power comes from how they are able to enchant others, able to draw them in with their stories
                            and songs. A good bard could persuade a king to have mercy on their greatest enemy, or convince a judge of 30 years of their innocence, despite being caught red handed. In the hands of a good person, the charm of a bard can
                            save thousands, in the hands of bad people; it can turn the noblest knight to corruption and evil.</p>
                        <p>Bards rarely take the violent path, either choosing to empower their allies, watching as their songs inspire fellow adventurers to push forth against even the most dangerous foes. While a barbarian or fighter may want to slay a
                            dragon and capture its horde of gold, a bard will likely try to reason with it, or even to seduce it into submission, pocketing their share as the dragon turns away, shyly. </p>
                        <p>Bards, unsurprisingly, are charisma based spellcasters, they rely on others being enthralled with the stories they tell, be it through words or through music. </p>
                        <p>Races best suited to be bards include humans, aasimar, dragonborn, tieflings and tabaxi, although the ‘classic’ image of the bard is that of a gnome or halfling. </p>

                        <p>Born of nature, one with nature, druids can feel the presence of nature from their skin to their bones. They’re blessed with abilities such as; talking to plants and animals, being able to spread life across desert, creating an
                            oasis at will and being able to change into a beast of the forest.</p>
                        <p>Picture this, it is the heat of battle, four elves stand at the end of a corridor, firing crossbows at you as you cower behind a flipped table. Suddenly, you notice a change in the usually timid gnome crouching next to you. Brown
                            fur begins to sprout from their skin, their eyes darken and they grow in size. Before they know it, a bear is charging at the elves, their arrows bouncing off its leathery skin. It tears them to ribbons, before slowly turning
                            back into that same timid gnome you thought you knew.</p>
                        <p>Druids rely on wisdom, on their ability to know their instincts will guide them in the right direction, to cast their spells. For this reason, races such as human, firbolg (giant kin who protect the forests) and loxodon (humanoid
                            elephants) are best suited to be druids.</p>

                        <p>Rangers are similar to druids in their abilities. They can feel perfectly at home in the marshy swampland, their equipment slung high on their shoulders to prevent it from getting wet, however they may be just as comfortable haggling
                            in the crowded marketplace of a bit city. </p>
                        <p>Rangers are generally seen as a mixture of a druid and a fighter. They have the ability to cast spells on their arrows before they fire them, and at later levels are able to create magical healing berries and teleport by entering
                            a tree and coming out of another. </p>
                        <p>Rangers also specialise, learning the complete information about certain types of terrain and enemies, gaining a significant advantage in fights against those chosen foes. There are many variants of ranger, such as the horizon
                            crosser, who steps between the dimensions to confuse and terrify their enemies in battle, or the hunter, who marks an enemy and then drives them into the ground with targeted attacks and fiery, magical arrows. </p>
                        <p>Rangers use their wisdom and dexterity to deliver hard hitting attacks laced with magical energy. For this reason, humans, aarakocra (humanoid birds who can fly), elves, halflings, kenku (half birds whose flight and voice was taken
                            from them) and tabaxi (humanoid felines) all make powerful rangers.</p>

                        <p>A blood hunter embraces evil and destruction, whether it is to destroy it, or to empower it. A blood hunter is a warrior like many others, but what sets them apart is their willingness to sacrifice their own vitality for the might
                            it may grant them. </p>
                        <p>As a blood hunter, you can enchant your weapons, dealing an array of damage types ranging from fire to psychic, in exchange for taking some damage. Additionally, you learn a handful of ‘blood curses’, which you can inflict on enemies.
                            These curses can be amplified, where they will produce a more powerful result in exchange for you taking damage. Some notable blood curses include: </p>
                        <ul type="disc">
                            <li>Blood curse of the eyeless – blind your enemies so that they have trouble attacking you</li>
                            <li>Blood curse of binding – stop your foes in their tracks, rooting them into the ground so they can’t run from you</li>
                            <li>Blood curse of mutual suffering – force a combatant to share all pain they inflict upon you</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Blood hunter is one of the most varied classes and can be somewhat complex when playing. If you wish to amplify your curses you may wish to have a high constitution, so that you can bear the damage you will do to yourself. If you
                            wish to focus on spell casting then you may wish to increase wisdom and if you want to empower your fighting abilities you may wish to focus on dexterity or strength, depending on whether you desire to be a ranged or melee
                            fighter. </p>
                        <p>For this reason, almost any race works well with the blood hunter class; however humans, firbolg, loxodon and kalashtar (half-dream people) work especially well due to their natural abilities. As blood hunter is not an ‘official’
                            class, always consult with your dungeon master before choosing to play it. </p>

                        <p>Unlike a cleric, who worships a deity, a warlock forms a ‘pact’ with a powerful being, their patron, who bestows them with magic. The relationship between a warlock and their patron can vary; it could be like that of an eager apprentice
                            and a wise master, or that of a slave and their owner. </p>
                        <p>Pacts are entered into for a variety of reasons; your warlock could’ve been born into a family of magic users unable to make any magic of their own, causing them to seek a patron who would grant them the magic they needed for their
                            family’s acceptance. You might’ve been lost at sea, stuck on a piece of driftwood slowly being sucked into a whirlpool, and had a voice speak out to you “give me your soul, and I’ll save you from this”. </p>
                        <p>Depending on the pact, warlocks can vary from frontline soldiers who summon their weapons into their hands from seemingly nowhere, to spellcasters whose pacts with fiendish devils allow them to hurl their enemies through a hellscape,
                            killing them by overloading their minds with horrific, incomprehensible imagery (yes that’s a real ability at level 14). </p>
                        <p>Having to bargain with their patron means that charisma is the main ability of the warlock. For this reason, races such as human, aasimar, dragonborn, tieflings and changelings (pale humanoids who can disguise themselves at will)
                            are the most suited for playing a warlock. </p>
                        <p>However, races such as elf, dwarf and genasi (creatures born of air, earth, fire or water) can be interesting to play as a combat-focused warlock, as their other abilities, such as improved constitution and dexterity, may serve
                            better when fighting on the front lines. </p>

                        <p>A simple oath, a small list of principles to be guided by. Anybody can follow this path, but for a paladin, this path is their life. A paladin is not just guided by the oath they take, they are defined by it. </p>
                        <p>A paladin is a warrior who swears to uphold a set of principles, an oath. This could be an oath of devotion, binding the paladin to the ideals of justice, virtue and prosperity, or an oath of redemption, motivating you to save
                            all you can, and turn those who are evil into virtuous, productive members of the societies they live in. </p>
                        <p>Not all paladins are good, however. Some take an oath of vengeance, seeking to find those who have slighted them in even the smallest way, and destroy their livelihoods, kill their families and burn their lands. Those who take
                            an oath of vengeance are to be avoided, and never to be wronged. </p>
                        <p>Others still may take an oath of conquest, believing that might is the guiding power of the world, and that the weak must be struck down to make way for the strong. Some paladins take an oath of the crown, becoming soldiers for
                            their kingdom, and guiding armies night and day. </p>
                        <p>Paladins rely on strength and charisma. As a fighter, it is important for the paladin to be able to swing a sword hundreds of times in just one battle, however they must also have the presence and confidence to lead and inspire
                            others to fight against whatever force threatens their oath. </p>
                        <p>Paladins can really be played by any race, as they are very versatile classes, however some of the races that are best for playing a paladin include; humans, dragonborn, triton (aquatic humanoids who guard the ocean depths) and
                            half-elves. </p>

                        <p>Clerics act as conduits for the power of the gods, channelling their might and manifesting it in ways that most people would call impossible. This isn’t granted to everyone, only devoted followers who have a higher calling, a destiny
                            they must fulfil. </p>
                        <p>Unlike wizards and sorcerers, clerics are not just spellcasters, but holy warriors too, who may at times depend on being on the frontlines to best utilise their magic. </p>
                        <p>Just as wizards have different schools and sorcerers have different bloodlines, so do clerics have a variety of deities they worship, varying from the grave domain, who guide spirits on the journey from life to death, to the war
                            domain, whose followers act as soldiers, embalming their swords with radiant power to cut down even the most powerful foe. There are more tame variants of clerics, however, such as the knowledge domain, which seeks to empower
                            the ideals of invention, tinkering and understanding. </p>
                        <p>No matter what domain you choose, a cleric is an awesome sight on a battlefield. They may revive a freshly dead enemy, right before turning around and sending a ray of searing light right into the killer. </p>
                        <p>Clerics rely on wisdom to cast their spells. They must be in touch with the wishes of their deity, so their intuition is most important to them. </p>
                        <p>For this reason, the races best suited to be clerics include; human, aarakocra (birdlike people who can fly), firbolg (giants who protect the forests) and kalashtar (humans bonded to spirits from the plane of dreams). </p>

                        <p>The path of the sorcerer, however, is different. A sorcerer has magic coursing through their every vein, being pumped from their heart all the way to the tips of their fingers, where a simple incantation can summon a fireball so
                            large and so hot it may burn a whole town to the ground, leaving nothing left but charred bricks and still smouldering planks of wood. </p>
                        <p>A sorcerer gains their magic from their bloodline. It could be that they are distantly related to ancient dragons, or that they are descended from the raw, wild powers that created the world itself. </p>
                        <p>Their arcane power isn’t always the result of direct heritage, however. It could be that their power is the result of a distant family curse, which may manifest itself in visions of past ancestors. Stranger yet, you may be the
                            reincarnation of a being from a different plane of existence, and your dreams may be plagued with the sight of a landscape you simply cannot comprehend. </p>
                        <p>For the sorcerer, spells are powered by your confidence in your abilities, your charisma. </p>

                        <p>Wizards get their arcane powers through intense study and discipline, learning the ins and outs of every spell that they prepare. Wizards, although they are all varied, tend to specialise in certain schools of magic. </p>
                        <p>Will you be a conjurer, who can summon demons onto the battlefield to fight for you? Perhaps a transmuter, who can double their size at will, and throw boulders at their enemies before shrinking to the size of a squirrel to infiltrate
                            a castle? Maybe even a necromancer who, with a swift flick of their hand, causes a whole army of enemies to wither to nothing. </p>
                        <p>The possibilities for playing a wizard are endless, and the power you gain can be used for good or evil. At some point in your games you will have to make the choice; do you want to save the world, or rule it? </p>
                        <p>Wizards use intelligence to power their spells. They study day in and day out, learning the verbal and material components of the spells that they cast. </p>
                        <p>As such, wizards are most suited for those races that tend to be the sages, engineers or tinkerers. Races best suited for a wizard include; humans, gnomes, vedalken (partially amphibious humanoids from the oceans) or tieflings

                        <p>A good rogue is never seen, whether that means they skulk in the shadows or hide in plain sight, that is up to them. They range from simple thieves to cunning assassins, scouring a 50 foot high wall to slink into the king’s chamber
                            through the window, administering one drop of deadly venom into the king’s open, snoring mouth, and then exiting the way they came. </p>
                        <p>As a rogue, you have lots of options of how you wish to play your character. You could be the deceiver, who manipulates politics from behind the scenes to gain access to the most powerful people, or the arcane trickster, pick pocketing
                            from nobles using a floating, magic hand, while you sit comfortably 50 feet away. </p>
                        <p>Rogues are able to sneak attack which, when used at the beginning of battle or during an ambush, can mean that they deal more damage than a barbarian. They also gain an improved dodge, meaning that they have the ability to take
                            no damage from a fireball thrown at them. </p>
                        <p>There are various archetypes to choose from. There are the assassins and the thieves, who are best when they aren’t seen or heard, and prefer one swift blow to a drawn out battle. There is the arcane trickster, who can use their
                            magic to aid in being unnoticed, even gaining a magical invisible hand that can fly about and manipulate objects for them. Finally, there is the inquisitive, who excels at discovering secrets and mystery. </p>
                        <p>Rogues all use dexterity, but depending on whether you plan to manipulate people or to be hidden, you will either want to choose charisma or intelligence. Races best for rogue include; human, elves, aaracokra, halflings and tabaxi.</p>
