                        <p>Changelings rarely have civilisations of their own, instead living amongst others in disguise. Their innate ability to not only change their appearance, but also their physical form itself can be used for evil or good. Some changelings
                            are tricksters or criminals, swindling their targets and, when pursued, slipping into a back alley and donning the visage of a common street urchin, asleep by a bin. Others may live simple lives, either amongst a small circle
                            of friends who know their secret or as a traveller, who might utilise their illusory nature to entertain. </p>
                        <p>In their natural form, changelings are generally pale, slender and average height. They may sport grey hair and eyes as well and have a fluid relationship to gender, which they can change at will. </p>

                            other races and can turn invisible and increase their size at will (duregar aren’t a core race, and you should consult your DM if you intend to play one). </p>

                            The average elf can live well over 700 years, meaning that, even in middle age, an elf will have seen and participated in how history has been written. </p>
                        <p>Elves are often creatures of nature, and dwell in small forest villages, creating great art for a living. Sometimes, they may breed with humans to create half-elves, and often will have many careers across their lifespan, becoming
                            a master of all trades by the time of their demise. </p>

                            underwater. Earth genasi are stubborn and strong, and may appear to always be dirty or to be as shiny as a pearl. Finally, the moods of the air genasi shift constantly and with little warning, and they are typically accompanied

                        <p>Enthusiastic little tinkerers, a gnome could make anyone smile with their blatant love of life. Gnomes stand at just over 3 feet tall and rarely exceed 50 pounds of weight, meaning they are often lost in the crowds or thought of
                            as ‘weak’. Their cunning more than makes up for their size, however, and gnomes are tied with humans for the most inventive, intelligent race, often being scholars, engineers, tricksters or jewellers. </p>
                        <p>Gnomes hail from the forest, the caves or from the depths. Deep gnomes are larger and a lot more rugged than the surface gnomes, and tend to be dry and cynical. Either way, gnomes share a boost to intelligence across their three
                            subraces, and as such are best suited to be wizards, artificers and rangers. This being said, gnomes are a greatly varied race and can reasonably play any class. </p>

                        <p>Despite how massive they are, loxodons are natural artisans, working as woodworkers, carpenters, painters, masons or stoneworkers. A loxodon is likely to live to about 450 years, meaning that they have plenty of time to work on

                        <p>Loxodons are usually those who bring a party together, and ensure that they stay together. A loxodon can usually diffuse any argument and bring those who are verbally sparring towards a peaceful parlay. For this reason, loxodons
                            would make great diplomats, if it were something they actually desired to do. </p>
                        <p>Loxodons, with their natural serenity and boosts to constitution and wisdom, make powerful clerics, paladins and druids. </p>

                        <p>A race of tradition, minotaurs consider themselves to live forever in their descendants, and for their ancestors to live forever through legends. For this reason, almost every minotaur name is drawn from a character from a past
                            legend, and they often re-enact these stories of old when they are together in communities. </p>
                        <p>While a minotaur isn’t always looking for a fight, it’s unlikely they’ll ever turn one down. Minotaurs are fearless creatures, with the musculature and martial-prowess to back up their bravado. A minotaur is a powerful addition
